This project uses synthetic NBA-style player data generated using NumPy and pandas.

No external dataset was used.

The dataset includes 100 generated samples with the following columns:
- Minutes_per_Game
- FG_Percentage
- Games_Played
- Points_per_Game (Target Variable)

This synthetic dataset is meant to resemble real-world NBA player stats for the purpose of building and comparing ML models.
